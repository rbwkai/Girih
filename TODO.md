## Task Distribution
Regardless the specifics, we all should
- Brainstorm
- Share Ideas and Progress to each other
- Ask for suggetions when stuck.

### Nayeem
- Define Line virtual struct @ src/object/core/line.hpp
- Implement a "line drawing" function
- Help Kabir in the "keyframe animation part" 
- Text Rendering if you're REALLYYY motivated.

> \-kabir

### Satty
- Implement RGBA color 
- Implement the draw function @ canvas/canvas.cpp
    - the curve drawn from many points should be *smooth*
    - Colors should be consistent(edgecase: a single pixel might get colored multiple times)


### Hasan
- Think of, and formulate as much useful **constraints** as possible.
- After nayeem defines Line, implement those constraints.
    - ***some useful constraints are***:
    - Midpoint
    - Internal and External Division points
    - Reflections
    - pi/2 rotation points
    - Equidistant point

### Kabir
- Work of Keyframing
- Visualization class (suspence for now, WIP)
